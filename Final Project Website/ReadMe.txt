So here is my final project for CS-290! It is a very simple webpage that has a login system. I used XAMPP to run my server for my php files and a mysqli database. As stated in my code it is important that the database is named the same 
when it is created for testing purposes.

For my first two websites I was merely getting comfortable again with HTML and CSS. I feel it is literally impossible to say I was doing anything right at all in these websites and I even knew this at the time, but I learned a lot
throughout this process that allowed my last few websites to be a little bit more interesting.

My third website covering javascript was a lot more fun to create and at least did something. I created a dummy login registration system that still has some issues. It still had no way to store the information besides locally in
the code.

My latest website I made before the final one, I learned a ton about how to actually get php files running and to run them on a server. I explained in the assignment the work that took, and it was super interesting to learn at least
one of the processes of getting things setup.

I sadly deleted my first repo's which had my opinions from the beginning of the term. I think that overall, my websites were pretty terrible until we started using javascript. That's when at least from a design point of view they started
to actually be useful and somewhat interesting.
