So I was going to preface this assignment by saying that it is split up into two folders,
one containing the CGI scripting with python and HTML. The second being PHP. I ran this on a 
raspberry pi at my dads house. Essentially I had to transfer the files using teamviewer
and learned a ton during the process on setting up a server to test php.

I had to: 
Install apache, mysql, and setup a raspberry pi. So now I have access to a raspberry pi from my
house to test php on.
