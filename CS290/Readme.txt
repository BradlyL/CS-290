This is the website for my eye doctor. It has been this way for years and I've contemplated asking him if I could help him move to something more modern. Honestly it's so basic
that it isn't hard to navigate, but it just looks unprofessional.

This website for the game runescape is pleasant to look at. There's no flashing lights or distractions and everything is where you'd expect it to be. It goes to show that you don't
need to have a bunch of sliding animations and fancy buttons to have a clean website.

Another game with an excellent website. The graphics are clean and there is a ton of spacing between text making things easy to read and find.

Truly an ugly website. Clashing colors and overall hard to navigate.

It's hard to believe this website actually sells things. It's very unprofessional looking and some of the links don't work.
